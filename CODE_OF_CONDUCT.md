# Code of Conduct

- This is very simple be **DECENT** and **TOLERANT** !
- Facts don't care about you feelings! If someone doesn't call you what you want to
  be called you have 3 options:
  1. Deal with it!
  2. Talk it out between the conflicting member\(s\).
  3. GTFO!
- What you do or say outside of the project has no bearings on the code you contribute or the ability _**\*\***_ to contribute
  *So please don't ever bother me with a complaint like this. "Hey Admin, John Doe is a second amendment lovers and is posting videos of him self in the range on twitter. This is encouraging violence." My response will be __"So, who cares!?"__*

# Note: "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"

_**\*\***_ There're two things that will get you obliterated from the project and those are **Pedophilia** and **Rape**. You will be gone yesterday and may God have no mercy on your soul!
